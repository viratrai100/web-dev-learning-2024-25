# üíº Virat Rai - HTML Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of **11 HTML projects** created as part of my web development journey. Projects 1 to 10 focus purely on HTML structure and concepts, while **Project 11 (Portfolio/Resume Website)** includes minimal internal CSS used specifically to maintain image quality and improve layout presentation ‚Äî not for full-scale visual decoration.
