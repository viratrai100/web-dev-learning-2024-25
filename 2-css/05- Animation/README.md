# 🎞️ CSS Animation Project

This project demonstrates the use of **CSS animations**, including different easing functions, directions, delays, iteration modes, and custom motion paths using `@keyframes`. It features animated boxes and a circular shape moving smoothly across a large container.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
  - Universal selector (`*`) for resetting margins, padding, and applying `box-sizing: border-box`
  - **CSS Animations**:
    - `@keyframes` to define movement paths
    - Full animation shorthand:  
      `animation: 5s linear 1s infinite alternate-reverse none running name;`
    - Individual properties tested:
      - `animation-name`
      - `animation-duration`
      - `animation-delay`
      - `animation-iteration-count`
      - `animation-timing-function` (`linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, `cubic-bezier(...)`)
      - `animation-direction` (`alternate`, `alternate-reverse`)
      - `animation-fill-mode`
      - `animation-play-state`
  - Responsive units (`vw`, `vh`, `%`) for full-screen layout
  - Positioning using `position: relative` with `top` and `left` transitions
  - Circle shape using `border-radius: 50px`
  - Color combinations: blue backgrounds with yellow borders for visibility

## 🎯 What I Learned

- How to **animate elements** in different directions using `@keyframes` and `animation` shorthand.
- Differences between various **timing functions** like `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in-out`, and custom `cubic-bezier(...)`.
- Practical use of `alternate`, `alternate-reverse`, and `infinite` iteration to create natural-looking loops.
- Experimented with animation `delay`, `fill-mode`, and other properties via **commented test cases** for deeper understanding.
- Designed multiple animated elements simultaneously:
  - One box moves **right to left**
  - One moves **left to right**
  - A **circle** follows a multi-point custom path

🎬 This project gave me hands-on experience with **advanced CSS animations** and how to fine-tune motion on the web.
