# 🌀 CSS Transition Project

This project demonstrates the use of **CSS transitions** to animate changes in size and color of a box element when hovered. It explores how transitions can be customized using different properties, durations, delays, and timing functions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
  - Transition properties explored:
    - `transition-property`
    - `transition-duration`
    - `transition-delay`
    - `transition-timing-function` (`linear`, `ease`, etc.)
  - Custom transition combination:
    - `transition: width 2s, height 5s;` for different durations
  - Hover effect on `.box` triggers:
    - Width: from `400px` to `1800px`
    - Height: from `400px` to `900px`
    - Background color change: `beige` to `blue`
  - Box design:
    - Dimensions: `400px x 400px`
    - Border: `2px solid black`

## 💬 Property Explanation & Comments

You tested multiple variations of `transition` by commenting and experimenting:

- `transition: all 2s;`  
  → Applies a 2s transition to all animatable properties.

- `transition: all 2s 5s;`  
  → 2s duration, 5s delay — useful for controlled animations.

- `transition: all 2s ease;`  
  → Uses `ease` for a smooth start and end.

- `transition: all 2s ease 1s;`  
  → Full shorthand: duration, easing function, delay.

- `transition: width 2s, height 5s;`  
  → Different durations for width and height transitions (used in final effect).

These comments and trials show you're **thoroughly testing** how each transition behaves — which is excellent practice for mastering CSS.

- How to apply **different durations** for width and height for a more dynamic visual.
- The effect of **delay** and `timing-function` on how and when the animation starts.
- Created a **visually impactful expanding box** with responsive behavior using just CSS.
