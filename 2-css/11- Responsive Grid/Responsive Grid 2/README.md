## 🚀 Technologies Used

- CSS3 (Grid Layout)

## 📚 What I Learned

- Applied `grid-template-areas` for intuitive grid mapping.
- Assigned named areas to elements via CSS using `grid-area`.
- Created a complex layout that's still responsive and well-structured.

### 💡 Comment Explanation

```css
grid-template-areas:
   "header header header"
   "sidebar content1 content1"
   "sidebar content2 content3"
   "footer footer footer";
// This defines the layout structure visually for better readability and control
```

- Every section like `#header`, `#sidebar`, etc., maps to a named area in the grid.
- Makes complex layouts easy to manage and adjust.

## 📝 Footer Year Note
